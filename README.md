# Plagiarism-Detector
Plagiarism is an act of copying or stealing someoneâ€™s idea or work. This act
should be stopped. Hence its always better to check if the content we are
developing is already implemented or written by some one else.
This software basically targets the students as the main audience. Whenever
developing a thesis or report the students face a lot of difficulties as they take
content from the sources but are not sure whether the content developed and
the sources are similar to what extent.
Usually its asked to students to wait for the completion of entire report and
then check the plagiarism which the college has access to. However, there are
a lot of sites which help check plagiarism but their databases does not contain
the entire documents. Hence the results are in accurate. For accurate results
we need to pay for the software.
Hence this project is developed without using the databases and is a handy
software for students to check the plagiarism while developing the content
itself.
